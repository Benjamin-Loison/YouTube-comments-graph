should have 6 468 868 comments according to realNumberOfComments.py - well finally not countring twice some comments (replying to youtuber for instance) we have 6 652 652 comments which seems to be more close
 - we can work from that and do my usages and during this step I might distinguish problems maybe
 - can still check which video has more than theory
 - after new patch have CPP 6 458 175 comments number which makes sens by being a bit under current result with python and not that much likewise may just have 10 693 new comments between
 25-08-21#01-58-19-433: working on Tibo InShape (UCpWaR3gNAQGsX48cIlQC0qw) 11 - 4
 and
 28-08-21#08-24-51-422: working on FRANCE 24 (UCCCPCZNChQdGa9EkATeye4g) 58 - 4
 that's 3 days and 6 hours
 which makes sens because last two videos have made more than 6k comments in 5 days
 
find with my CPP algo: 7 638 152 comments
maybe it is because some videos are not repertoried but show with allThreadsRelatedToChannelId parameter
no hopefully for privateness however the problem may comes from the fact that it might count twice a same comment

none of comments disabled videos have comments
