How you know channel "nationality" ?

Hello,

I would like to know how you know the "nationality" of a YouTube channel because for instance some in Top 100 french ( https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/country/fr/mostviewed ) more precisely "bonnietylerVEVO" who according to Wikipedia information etc isn't French. Do you specify each channel nationality by hand or have you ways to get "nationality" of a channel ? If so I would be interested to know how you get this piece of information.

Thank you

Why is bonnietylerVEVO country France ?

Hello,


bonnietylerVEVO country isn't France according to many sources of information (including Wikipedia). Have you done a mistake by considering her channel as a French one ?


Best regards,
